# hna drna everything at once, first thing we did is we doubled each number (using the map), ki tji tchouf we didn't store the result of the map in a variable, we just passed it directly to the filter
# then we filtered the doubled numbers to keep only those greater than 10, as you can see in line 23
# finally, we summed up the filtered numbers using reduce
